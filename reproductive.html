		<p>The Reproductive system is a series of organs inside and out of the body that helps with the reproductive cycle of life. Reproductive organs are in both male and female bodies and they are used for procreation. The reproductive organs include the penis and the vagina. </p>
		<h2  id="FUNCTIONS">FUNCTIONS </h2>
		<p>The male reproductive system&rsquo;s purpose is to produce sperm; the testicles are the organs that make the sperm. Semen is made when fluids from the seminal vesicles and the prostate gland combines with sperm. The penis ejaculates semen during sexual intercourse. </p>
		<p>The female reproductive system&rsquo;s purpose is to create egg cells called the ova or oocytes; the ovaries make these egg cells. The oocytes are then transported to the fallopian tube where fertilization by a sperm may occur. The egg that has been fertilized goes to the ovaries, where the lining in the uterine has thickened responding to the hormones of the reproductive system .The fertilized egg continues to develop once in the uterus and it has implanted into the thickened uterine outline. The uterine lining is shed as menstrual flow if fertilization does not happen. The female reproductive system also produces sex hormones to maintain the reproductive system. </p>
		<h2 id="DISEASES">DISEASES </h2>
		<p>Diseases in the reproductive system are called STDs (sexually transmitted diseases) and can be very dangerous. HIV/Aids is an example of a common STD. There is no cure for HIV/Aids yet and most children die off young if they are born from parents with it. Other diseases include herpes and pubic lice. As the name suggests, you get an STD by sexually transmitting it, such as through vaginal sex, oral sex, and anal sex. </p>
		<h2 id="MAINTAINING_A_HEALTHY_SYSTEM">MAINTAINING A HEALTHY SYSTEM</h2>
		<p>To maintain a healthy reproductive system, one must eat a balanced diet, drink a lot of water, exercise regularly, maintain normal weight, get enough sleep, avoid smoking and using drugs/ alcohol, etc. and manage stress in a healthy way.
